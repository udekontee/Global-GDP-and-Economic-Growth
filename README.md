# Global GDP and Economic Growth Analysis (2015-2024)
This repository analyzes global GDP trends and growth rates from 2015 to 2024 using data from data.gov. It utilizes MySQL, R, Excel, and Tableau for data cleaning and visualization, providing insights into the economic performance of various countries through charts and graphs.

## Project Overview
This project conducts a thorough analysis and visualization of global GDP trends and growth rates from 2015 to 2024, leveraging data from diverse countries. It aims to uncover critical economic patterns and insights that can guide informed decision-making in economic policy and strategic investments.

## Tools Used
- MySQL: For data storage and initial cleaning.
- R: For data analysis and visualization using packages such as ggplot2, dplyr, janitor, and skimr.
- Excel: For additional data manipulation and visualization.
- Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset includes GDP values for various countries from 2015 to 2024, as well as calculated total GDP and average growth rates. The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis using SQL and R.

### Key Features of the Dataset:
- Columns include country names, GDP for each year, total GDP, and average growth rates.
- The dataset is free from missing values and duplicates, ensuring accuracy in analysis.
  
### Data Source:
The data used for this project is sourced from **[data.gov](https://www.data.gov)**, a comprehensive resource for U.S. government data.

## Analysis and Visualizations
### Key Analyses Conducted:
1. Top 10 Countries by Total GDP: Identified the leading economies based on total GDP.
2. Highest Growth Rates (2023-2024): Analyzed the fastest-growing economies within this timeframe.

### Types of Visualizations:
- Bar Chart: Total GDP by Country.
- Line Chart: Growth rates for the top 10 countries.
- Donut Chart**: Distribution of total GDP among the top 10 countries.
- Scatter Plot**: Relationship between total GDP and growth rates.

  ## Visualizations
## GDP Comparison of Leading Economies, 2019 - 2024
  The chart titled **"GDP Comparison of Leading Economies, 2019 - 2024"** illustrates the GDP trends for ten major economies, including Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States over five years. Each colored line represents GDP values for the years 2019 through 2024. Notably, China** leads significantly in GDP, followed closely by the United States, indicating their dominant positions in the global economy. Germany and France show stable GDP figures, while India demonstrates a steady upward trajectory. The chart highlights fluctuations in Brazil's GDP, suggesting economic volatility, while other countries like Korea and Italy maintain moderate growth.
